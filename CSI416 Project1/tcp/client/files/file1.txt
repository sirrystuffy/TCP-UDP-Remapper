augusta ada king countess of lovelace was an english mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on charles babbage proposed mechanical general purpose computer the analytical engine she was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine as a result she is often regarded as the first computer programmer 
her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as andrew crosse charles babbage sir david brewster charles wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens contacts which she used to further her education ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an analyst and metaphysician
when she was a teenager her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow british mathematician charles babbage who is known as the father of computers she was in particular interested in babbage work on the analytical engine lovelace first met him in june eighteen thirty three through their mutual friend and her private tutor mary somerville
between eighteen forty two and eighteen forty three ada translated an article by italian military engineer luigi menabrea about the analytical engine supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes simply called notes lovelace notes are important in the early history of computers containing what many consider to be the first computer program that is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine other historians reject this perspective and point out that babbage personal notes from the years contain the first programs for the engine she also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number crunching while many others including babbage himself focused only on those capabilities her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the analytical engine as shown in her notes examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool
